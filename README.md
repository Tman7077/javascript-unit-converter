# Overview

This project served as an opportunity to learn the basics of JavaScript, and how it interacts with HTML and CSS. 
I learned about eventListeners and how to use named functions with them, as well as their different types of activation, among other things.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment, and used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Useful Websites

I used a few websites to help answer my questions as I went along, specifically the following:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# Future Work

- There are slight inaccuracies in calculation due to my use of decimals in the unit conversion dictionary,
and it would be wise to modify the way that handles data to produce even more accurate results.
- For example, converting inches to feet is not 100% accurate, because it really converts
inches to kilometers, and then kilometers to feet, based on a two-digit decimal.
It's extremely close, down to a ten-thousandth of an inch, but not perfect.
